In this small project i'm searching for the answer on the question: what's the profile of an average NBA player in this years regular NBA season ('18-'19)?

I analyze and visualize the variables weight, age, height and team ofa dataset in which all players of the NBA season '18 -'19 are included. This way we can tell which player comes closest to the average profile of a NBA player.
