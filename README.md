# Analysis NBA Season '18-'19 - This is the Profile of an Average NBA Player

In this project i'm searching for the answer on the question: what's the profile of an average NBA player in this years regular NBA season ('18-'19)?

I analyze and visualize the variables weight, age, height and team, take the averages of these values, combine them and put this data over the dataset. All players of the NBA season '18 -'19 are included in this dataset. This way we can tell which player comes closest to the average profile of a NBA player.
